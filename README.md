This is web application for managing IQRF Gateway Daemon's configuration.

## Installation

See the installation guide [here](https://docs.iqrf.org/iqrf-gateway/webapp-install.html).

## Requirements

PHP 7.3 or higher. To check whether server configuration meets the minimum requirements for [Nette Framework](https://doc.nette.org/3.0/requirements).

### Web server

For Apache or Nginx, setup a virtual host to point to the `www/` directory of the project and you should be ready to go.

It is *CRITICAL* that whole `app/`, `log/` and `temp/` directories are not accessible directly via a web browser. See [security warning](https://nette.org/security-warning).
